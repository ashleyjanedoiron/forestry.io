      <h2>How We Hire</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="big">Our hiring process involves multiple steps, the first being an introductory chat to gauge mutual interest and gain clarity into each other’s needs and expectations.</p>
        <p>If it feels like a good fit, we’ll schedule a “Life Story” interview. Our goal in this step is to learn how your professional life has developed, what you value, what motivates you, and how you’ve grown into the person you are today.</p>
        <p>After getting to know you better, we then hold a series of interviews with various team members with the goal of examining the depth and breadth of your skill set. We like to think about your skills and areas for potential growth both in the context of the role and in the broader context of our company as a whole. In the last step, we’ll have a diverse group of people review and discuss our applicants before making a decision.</p>

      <h2>Benefits to Enjoy</h2>
      <div class="careers-columns">
        <div>
          <h3>Remote first</h3>
          <p>We want you to do great work, and have a great life outside of work, so we’re advocates of remote-working. This allows us to hire great talent from anywhere, and allows you to live the kind of life you want, where you want (we also have an HQ in PEI, Canada).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Remote employee allowance</h3>
          <p>We want to ensure our remote workforce has a great setup for their workspace, so we have a $2,500 USD annual allowance for all remote employees. Due to the COVID-19 situation, this benefit is temporarily being extended to employees that normally work out of our PEI HQ.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div>
          <h3>Annual company onsite in PEI</h3>
          <p>Remote? We still want to meet you face-to-face. We’ll fly you to our HQ in Prince Edward Island for a week at some point during your first month with us. We also have a week-long company onsite in PEI during the summer each year.</p>
        </div> -->

        <div>
          <h3>Competitive salaries, based on location</h3>
          <p>We calculate our salaries based on job level and the cost of living & market where you live, so we are able to provide competitive salaries regardless of where you’re working from.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Flexible work hours</h3>
          <p>We’re a distributed team, and we don’t have a set schedule that everyone abides by. People typically work during the common daylight hours in their timezone, but may shift a couple hours in one direction or another to overlap better with specific team members or meetings, depending on what they’re working on.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Sustainable pace</h3>
          <p>We're a startup where things move and change fast, but that doesn’t mean overtime is expected. We value rest & life outside of work. If you happen to be working a lot of overtime to meet a deadline, expect to take some extra time off shortly after.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Health plan</h3>
          <p>Medical, dental, vision, and life insurance are available to full-time employees through Aetna & MetLife in the US and Medavie Blue Cross in Canada.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Your workstation, your way</h3>
          <p>Want an ergonomic keyboard? You can have it. Dual monitors? Of course. Mac, Ubuntu, Windows? Use whatever you want, as long as you can do what you need to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Vacation & personal time</h3>
          <p>We have 3 weeks of discretionary vacation, and a 4th week off between Christmas and New Years when our office is closed. We also have personal days on an as-needed basis for self-care.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Floating holidays</h3>
          <p>Half of our holidays are shared. The other half are floating, so you can take local holidays in your country of residence.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Parental leave</h3>
          <p>When you welcome a child to your family, Forestry offers up to 78 continuous weeks of combined maternity and parental leave. A 100% salary top-up is provided for primary caregivers for 6 weeks, and secondary caregivers for 3 weeks. An additional top up to 55% salary is provided for 6 and 3 weeks respectively.</p>
